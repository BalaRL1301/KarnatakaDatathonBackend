#application build procedures
Initally we build the user interface for our application for both user and admin are the those we uses our application. 
Then we integrate the LogIn and Regestration page into the database with authentication with the help of firebse.
For the active Emergency vehicle we created the python programming with the help of flask and uploaded to the server (Render) to host it to publically.
==> here is the user interface for the ADMIN  "https://karnatakadatathonbackend.onrender.com/view_table"

So, we had integrated the application to the server so that they can update the location for every 3 seconds untill they deactive the ambulance
